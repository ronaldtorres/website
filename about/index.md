I’m Pedro Piñera Buendía, 🇪🇸 iOS Developer currently working at SoundCloud as Core iOS Engineer. Even though I studied Telecommunication Engineer I became interested in mobile development back in 2010 and I’ve been doing that since then. I’ve worked for companies like Redbooth](https://redbooht.com), [8fit](https://8fit.com) and recently [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com). I’m a passionate runner and traveller. I’m always willing to learn new things and become a better developer and person. I like sharing what I learn and I do it on this website but also in a Newsletter that you can [subscribe to](http://eepurl.com/b9-25H). I’m a strong believer in the power of openness. I’m open in many aspects of my life such as sharing the problems that I’m facing in life, my new discoveries as a developer, or the projects I work on that can be useful for more developers. Most of my spare time projects are Open Source libraries that I share on my GitHub account. You can check them out [here](https://github.com/pepibumur).

<br><br>

In my free time, I’ve also worked on projects like [GitDo](http://gitdo.io), an Issues management tool for GitHub, and some other apps with [Caramba](https://github.com/caramba). We craft apps and tools for developers. We, as a developer, have great tools to make this world better, why not using them?

## Trello Growth Board

I strongly believe in openness and the importance of sharing our learnings with the people around us. Since life is also a project and we learn along the way I decided to create a [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/V0KvuwXq/growth) where I have a personal backlog with things I'd like to learn, watch, read, and also small life projects that I'm about to accomplish. Feel free to have a look, comment or give me some ideas :).

## Skills

- Setup project with an scalable structure and connect it with a **CI environment** (like Travis-CI, Jenkins, Wercker)

- **Strong layout experience** using Autolayouts in case of iOS and building layouts from scratch on Android. *In favour of coding Autolayout constraints*.
- **Mobile Architectures** for scalable and modular apps. Experience architecturing Swift/Objective-C projects in multiple frameworks in order to build cross platform applications.
- **Release processes** using versioning tools *(using milestones, releases, tags and branches to keep a clear vision of the release process and have everything coordinated and perfectly integrated)*

**Other Skills**

- Experience in **Ruby**, developed small gems wich different purposes. I have also a few of experience with **Rails**.

## Work experience

### [Redbooth](https://redbooth.com/)
I started with Redbooth in 2013 and I joined the iOS team to work remotely (I was finishing the University) as a Freelance. During the that year I was working for Redbooth I improved my knowledge on areas like data persistance, API interactions, Core Data, mobile architectures, Objective-C patterns, and had the opportunity to deal with XMPP helping the company to build its own chat client integrated into the company's solution. Moreover I had the opportunity to develop for the Android team too which for me was a good chance to dive into the Android development. I've been improving my Android background since them and although it's not at the level of the iOS one it's pretty one.

### [8fit](http://8fit.com/)
Ending 2014 I left Redbooth to join 8fit, founded by Pablo Villalba, which founded the company I was working with. He had started a new project that year and I got so motivated with it that I couldn't say no. On that new job position I assumed the role of mobile lead managing both, iOS and Android projects and supporting the web-app solution to offer the best mobile experience as possible. I'm covering with 8fit things like In-App-Purchase payments, Android Expansion Packs, Mobile-Web patterns, Healthkit and GoogleFit integrations, and I'm even learning Javascript and doing some stuff on the frontend side.

### [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com)
I joined SoundCloud in October 2015 as iOS developer. During the time I've been working for SoundCloud so far I've learnt about the use of Reactive programming in an very consolidated codebase and improved my architectural knowledge with new patterns I hadn't used before. Moreover I learnt about the importance of testing for apps development, since we have CI pipelines defined that run Unit and Acceptance tests.

### [GitDo](http://gitdo.io)
GitDo is my spare time project. I started with a college I worked with before at Redbooth. This project taught me about team management, product design, the importance of company values, ... I was founder of the project and I had to get my head out of the coding editor. I'm very excited about all the things I'm learning with that project.


## Open Source projects

### Actively Maintained

- **PPiFlatSegmentedControl:** PPiFlatSegmentedControl is an UI Control developed avoiding original UISegmentedControl to get interesting features related with the flat design. For better appearance you can add Font Awesome library to your project and use their icons into the Segmented Control. [Link](https://github.com/pepibumur/PPiFlatSegmentedControl)
- **MagicMP:** I noticed that the new MultiPeer framework introduced in iOS 7 was segmented in two main components and still using delegates. The framework has an abstraction layer in viewController format to explore nearby users, or advertiser devices, but.. What if we don't want to implement the module using viewControllers? Here's where MagicMP appears, it unifies both components in an easy way, with blocks and a singleton class, use whenever you want without depending on a ViewController. [Link](https://github.com/pepibumur/MagicMP)
- **PPiShowtime-Google-iOS-Library:** Get showtimes from any City thanks to Google Showtime. I discovered there was no option to access to this information so I decided to parse the information directly from their Website. As iOS Developer I thought it would be useful to release a Objective-C class to get/parse this information for all developers. I called it PPiShowtime.
