As I mentioned in other blog posts,
Tuist is more than a project generation tool.
Getting the project generation right was crucial because it's the foundation for the future that we have planned.
We don't support all the features that Xcode offers,
but I'm happy that the ones that we support are well supported and in some cases simplified.

I think one needs to be ambitious in life if they want to achieve their goals,
and my ambition for Tuist is to be the [Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) of apps built with Xcode.
Rails emerged because building web apps back then was tedious and complex.
There were abstractions,
but none of them sparked joy.
For that reason DHH & Basecamp started building Rails.
It might not be a good fit for all projects,
yet it does a good job at what it does:
it provides abstractions for the common functionalities of any web app,
and most importantly, it's fun to work with it.

I found working with Xcode projects tedious and complex.
It was not fun having to picture in someone's mind the dependency graph to set the right settings.
It was not fun not being able to get an overview of the project structure to make project decisions.
It was not fun waiting for a long compilation to finish to get a _"framework not found"_ error.
It was not fun that only one person in the team could make decisions around the project structure.
It was not fun having to maintain brittle logic in Fastfiles, or figuring out issues in the middle of a release.

Instead of accepting that as a reality,
and hoping for Apple to do something on their end,
I found myself with enough motivation and knowledge to make Xcode projects fun and embarked on building Tuist.
In this blog post,
I'm sharing what fun means to me,
and how that relates to the future of Tuist.

### Dependencies

You are probably familiar with [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage), [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/), and the [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/). They are dependency managers, and many teams use them to

### The build system validating the project settings

### Git conflicts

### Reusability of project
