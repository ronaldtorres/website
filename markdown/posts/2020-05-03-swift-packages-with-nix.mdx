At Shopify,
our dev infrastructure team introduced [Nix](https://nixos.org/nix/) in our internal tool dev that every developer has in their laptop.
The main motivation behind using Nix as a package manager is to make the configuration of the environments deterministic and reproducible.
_How often have you heard the "it works on my laptop"?_
Nix alongside deterministic build systems should mitigate those issues.

Since [Burke](https://twitter.com/burkelibbey) started advocating for it internally and publishing [useful content](https://twitter.com/burkelibbey/status/1256233815812554752) around the topic,
I've been reading about Nix â€” mostly the documentation and the [Nix pills](https://nixos.org/nixos/nix-pills/).
I find the idea behind it fascinating,
but the amount of concepts fairly overwhelming.
At Shopify we don't have to deal with Nix's concepts directly because those are abstracted by dev,
but I wanted to get familiar with them myself to use them from the [`tuist up`](https://tuist.io/docs/commands/up/) feature.
Tuist's users run `tuist up` to install tools like [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) and [SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint),
and they experience the same issues that led Shopify to adopt Nix:
_non-deterministic results._

To consolidate what I've read so far,
I thought it'd be a good idea to define a [derivation](https://nixos.org/nixos/nix-pills/our-first-derivation.html) to install a tool like SwiftLint.
In this blog post I'll share the steps that I took to define and build it,
and talk about some potential improvements that we could add in the future.

## Derivation

## Future improvements

- **Set up a binary cache:** Another benefit of using Nix is being able to leverage the [binary cache](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Binary_Cache) to share built packages with other people.
  If a developer is trying to build a package to install it locally, and another developer has already built it, Nix would pull it from the cache. Awesome, isn't it?
- **Re-use transitive dynamic targets:** Each transitive dependency that the Swift Package Manager (SPM) needs to build for SwiftLint could be a derivation.
  That'd allow reusing dynamic targets from the Nix store against which the SPM could link dependant targets.
  A feature like this would require an integration between Nix and the SPM's build system.
