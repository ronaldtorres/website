Before developing Tuist, I had to develop `XcodeProj`, a Swift library for reading, updating and writing Xcode projects, workspaces and schemes. I debated between developing `XcodeProj` as an internal component of `Tuist`, or rather, implement it on its own repository and make it distributable through CocoaPods, Carthage and the Swift Package Manager. I opted for the latter.

Nowadays, `XcodeProj` is powering several other tools like [XcodeGen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/xcodegen) or [Accio](https://github.com/JamitLabs/Accio). I'm glad that other developers found in XcodeProj the opportunity to develop their own tooling and it's exciting to see all the ideas they come up with.
