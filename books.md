In this page I keep track of the books that I read. Before the creation of this page, I used to use [GoodReads](https://www.goodreads.com/), which provides handy features such as recommendations, but alongside social features *(follows, likes, comments)* that make the platform the Facebook of books. Because I don't want my reading to be a social game, I stayed away from it. I get recommendations from friends or just in the book stores, and update this page with the books that I read in case anyone is interested.

## Read

### [The learning photographer - scholarly texts on Hans Georg Berger's art work in Laos and Iran](https://trove.nla.gov.au/work/157104513?q&versionId=171256754)

- **Rating:** ★★★★★
- **Finished:** January 2019
- **Thoughts:** I bought this book at a restaurant in Luang Prabang during my trip around Asia. I had just arrived to the country and lacked many historical and cultural context. This book helped me discover more about the city, Luang Prabang, and the country, Laos. It's organized as a series of interviews to Hans Georg Berger, a German photographer who dedicated a large amount of his work to understand and capture the life, culture and the buddhist religion in the area. In the interview, he talks about what motivated him to do so, his learnings, and how he understands photography as a beautiful connection between a subject and the observer. 

### [Future ethics](https://www.future-ethics.com/) by Cennydd Bowles
- **Rating:** ★★☆☆☆
- **Finished:** January 2019
- **Thoughts:** I started reading this book because I'm became more concerned about ethics and the goodwills of the software that I build. The book touches on very interesting topics such as privacy, artificial intelligence o mass surveillance. It's a thought-provoking book that makes you think about the side effects that the supposedly non-harmful technology that we build might have. Although I find those topics intriguing, I think the lack of cohesion between different sections, and the structure of the chapters makes the reading monotonous and hard to follow.

### [Eloquent Ruby](http://eloquentruby.com/) by Russ Olsen
- **Rating:** ★★★★★
- **Finished:** November 2018
- **Thoughts:** Before I started reading this book, I had been doing Ruby for a few months. I knew the concepts were more than necessary to develop software in Ruby, but some things were sort of magic to me. Why can class methods be defined with `class << self`? Why does a second definition of a class merge into the first one? How does Rake do to read and run the tasks from a `Rakefile`? This book answers those, and some other questions to help you better understand the principles of the language and common patterns that you'll come across. Each chapter focus on one area of the language, and together with the explanation, it gives you real-world examples and tips to avoid common mistakes. Very recommended to level up as a Ruby developer.
